# Udacicards

## TL;DR

To get started:

* Have a simulator/emulator or a real mobile device ready
* `yarn install && yarn start`
* Follow the directions at the prompt to run the app

## What You're Getting

This application is all about flashcards.

The user can create sets of flashcards. A set of flashcards is called a deck. Once a deck is created and cards have been added to the deck, the user can quiz themselves by cycling through the cards in the deck and indicating whether they knew the correct answer. When the quiz is finished, the user is given a score and the option to restart the quiz or return to view the deck.

Decks can be deleted. Cards cannot be deleted.

All data is stored unencrypted on the user's device.

A daily notification is sent to the user to remind them to study.

### Platform Support

This app has been tested on the iOS Simulator (iPhone 7, iOS 10.3) and the Moto X4 (Android).

## Why?

This app was developed as part of my coursework for the React Nanodegree course from Udacity. It's the third project out of three.

## How?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
